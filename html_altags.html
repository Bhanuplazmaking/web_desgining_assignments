<strong>Roranoa zoro</strong>(Japanese pronounciation:[ロロノア・ゾロ](listen);first apperance one piece chapter 3)is the first crewmate to join Monkey D. Luffy's crew after he is saved (by Luffy and Koby) from being executed at the Marine Base by Captain Morgan. He is the crew's combatant,[4] and one of the two swordsmen of the Straw Hat Pirates, the other being Brook. He is also known as the vice-captain of the Straw Hat Pirates as he was the 1st to join the Straw Hat Pirates and he is the second strongest member of the crew after Luffy(Captain). He is also the most loyal member to Luffy and respects him and his every decision. He has an extremely poor sense of direction, which is a running gag throughout the whole series. He's the son of Roronoa Arashi and Tera and is the grandson of <em>Shimotsuki Furiko and Roronoa Pinzoro</em>

Personality

Zoro has a stern, serious, and distanced personality, but unlike Robin, he often reacts in a goofy and exaggerated comic style due to his short-tempered and impatient attitude. On the ship, he normally either trains with weights or sleeps. The only work he is seen doing regularly is hoisting the anchor using his great strength and maintaining a lookout in the ship's crow's nest (which on the Thousand Sunny ship also doubles as his personal gym). He also likes sake, almost to the degree that Luffy likes meat, but like Nami, he never gets drunk due to his inhumanly-high endurance and tolerance for alcohol. Another notable trait is his lack of orientation, as Zoro often gets lost, even in small, familiar spaces or when being led by someone. Despite this, he is often the first to sense an enemy or danger and the first to react. He is often displayed as being well aware of dangerous situations and the people around him.

Zoro often reminds others of the harsh facts, which shocks some of the other crew members, although they usually decide he is right. It can be seen when Luffy and Usopp had a fight and Usopp left the crew, Zoro said that Luffy is the captain of the ship and everyone must respect him without any exception and so Usopp must apologize to Luffy before he joins the crew. And he also added that if Luffy takes in Usopp without his apology to Luffy then next one leaving the crew will be Zoro himself. Later everyone understood him and decided that Zoro is right about it. Zoro is an atheist because he stated that he does not pray to any god, could not care one way or the other, and has never believed in anything except himself and for him only one man is above him(i.e. Luffy). He has also stated that he would follow Luffy till the end of his journey i.e. becoming the King of the Pirates but Luffy should not come between him and his dream either i.e. becoming the world's strongest Swordsman ( currently: Dracule Mihawk ). Even so, Zoro knows that he still has much-untapped potential and is constantly seen training and improving his fighting skills. He also adheres to a strict sword master's code of honor and never falsely brags or lies about his abilities, sometimes outright admitting a weakness, even to an enemy. He also never tries to escape from a fight or use trickery to win, believing that doing so is cowardly and scorning anyone who uses such tactics. Zoro is vigorous, strong-willed, and determined.


Haki

He is proficient in both Armament and Observation Haki, as well as one of the few known characters who possess Conquerors Haki. During his battle against King, Zoro unlocks an advanced form of Conquerors Haki, which gave him the ability to coat his swords with it, similar to Armament Haki, which could further enhance his attacks. He also uses an advanced form of Armament Haki to shoot a short blast of Haki from a distance.
